-- So what does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query?
-- AND P1.ID < P2.ID; is a way to select one of the two names to display, and ensures a record does not register as having the same name as itself.

-- The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which you’d want to join a table to itself?
-- In the case of a tie for the highest score with our current SQL code, only one of the tied players will be listed as having won the game.
